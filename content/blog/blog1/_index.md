### Question
Let $k$ be a positive integer, and let $\epsilon$ be a positive real number. Prove that there are infinitely many positive integers $n$, such that the largest prime factor of $n^k + 1$ is less than $n^\epsilon$
### Solution
In the whole solution k and $\epsilon$ is fixed.
#### Claim 1:
The set of prime divisors of \{$n^k+1$ :$n\in\mathbb{N}$\} is an infinite set.
#### Proof:
For the sake of contradiction say $\exists$ only finitely many of them say$\{p_1,p_2,\dots,p_r\}$.Now set $n=p_1p_2{\dots}p_r$. Now we see none of $p_i$,where $i\in\{1,2,\dots,r\}$ divide $n^k+1$. Which is a contradiction.

Hence, the set of largest prime $p$ such that $p\mid(n^k+1)$ where $n\in\{1,2,3,\dots\}$ is infinite. If not say there are finitely many of them, say for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$ $n^k+1$ has a largest prime factor among the set$\{p_1,p_2,\dots,p_k\}$ but now again setting $n=p_1p_2{\dots}p_k$ we get a contradiction.

#### Claim 2:
$\forall\hspace{0.2 cm} \delta > 0 \hspace{0.2 cm}\exists$ infinitely many $m \in \mathbb{N}$
such that  $\frac{\varphi(2m)}{2m}<\delta$ ,where $\varphi(n)$ is the euler totient function.
#### Proof:
 Let the odd primes be \(p_1 < p_2 < \cdots\) and set \(m=p_1p_2\cdots p_k\). Then
 \begin{equation*}
\lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{\varphi(2m)}{2m}=\lim_{k\to\infty}\prod_{p\mid2m}{\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)}<e^{\lim_{k\to\infty}\left(-\sum_{p\mid2m} \left(\frac{1}{p} \right)\right)} < \delta
\end{equation*}
Since $\sum_{p\mid2m} \frac{1}{p}$ diverges to $\infty$, $e^{\left(-\sum_{p\mid2m} \left(\frac{1}{p} \right)\right)}$ converges to $ 0$. And hence our previous line is justified, which completes our proof.

#### Fact:
1. \[x^n-1=\prod_{d mid n}\Phi_d(x)\]
Where $\Phi_d(x)$ is the d-th cyclotomic polynomial.
 2. deg($\Phi_d(x)$) is $\varphi(d)$.

So we have
\begin{equation*}
x^{2n}-1=\prod_{d\mid2n}\Phi_d(x)
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\Rightarrow (x^n-1)(x^n+1)=\prod_{d\mid2n}\Phi_d(x)
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\Rightarrow (x^n+1)=\prod_{{d\mid2n}{\hspace{0.1cm}d\nmid n}}\Phi_d(x).
\end{equation*}

Now set n=$r^m$ for some $r \in\mathbb{N}$
$\Rightarrow n^k=r^{mk}$
Take $\epsilon_o=\frac{\epsilon}{k}$.
If $p\mid(n^k+1)$ then $p$ should divide some $\Phi_d(r^k)$ where $d\mid2m \hspace{0.1 cm}and \hspace{0.1 cm} d{\nmid}m$.(Here we would refer $p$ as the largest prime factor of $n^k+1$).

### Claim 3:
If $d\mid2m \hspace{0.1 cm}and \hspace{0.1 cm} d{\nmid}m$ then we have $\varphi(d)<\varphi(2m)$.
### Proof:
Writing d in its prime factorisation form ,writing k in its prime factorisation form and keeping in mind that $d\mid2m \hspace{0.1 cm} and \hspace{0.1 cm}d{\nmid}m$ it is quite straight forward to see.

Now since by **Claim2** we have for any $\delta >0$ we have infinitely many $m\in\mathbb{N}$ for which $\frac{\varphi(2m)}{2m}<\delta$.
Setting $\delta=\frac{\epsilon_o}{2}$ we have infinitely many $m\in\mathbb{N}$  such that
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\varphi(2m)}{2m}<\frac{\epsilon_o}{2}
\Rightarrow \varphi(2m)<m\epsilon_o
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation}
    \Rightarrow \varphi(d)<\varphi(2m)<m\epsilon_o
\end{equation}
Since $p\mid\Phi_d(r^k)$ so we should have $p\le\Phi_d(r^k)$
Now for large enough $x \in \mathbb{N}$ we have $\Phi_d(x)\approx x^{\varphi(d)}$
$\Rightarrow \Phi_d(r^k)\approx r^{k\varphi(d)}$
so we have $p\le\Phi_d(r^k)\approx r^{k\varphi(d)}\le r^{k\varphi(2m)}<r^{km\epsilon_o}=n^{k\epsilon_o}=n^{\epsilon}$.

Now since from **Eqn 1** we get infinitely many such m's for which $\varphi(d)<m\epsilon_o$ and since $n=r^m$ we get infinitely many such $n \in\mathbb{N}$ and for all of them we have $p<n^{\epsilon}$  and hence this completes our proof.
